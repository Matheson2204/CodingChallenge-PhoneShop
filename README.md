# CodingChallenge-PhoneShop

Started out designing the HTML elements of the webpage to construct the item cards, then the order detail grid. Used the BootStrap elements for the card-body, and the grid.

Next up I started styling the HTML with CSS for the cards and the grid. theres a few descrepencies with the design, that i'm still working on the fix but I desided to leave that as a small priority to work on the JavaScript functionality of the webpage.

The Javascript functionality consist of 2 buttons for submit aka 'add to cart'(work in progress) and the delete button aka 'Remove' within the grid. I also added form control input box for the quantity of the target item which disables the input box ability for quantity to be less then 1.

Other functionality includes the ability to updating the grids boxes with new data for the card and add the price and quantity for a total price of the item. Then add all the items totals into a overall Total price (still working on that).
